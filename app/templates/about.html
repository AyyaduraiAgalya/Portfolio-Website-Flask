    <h2>Professional Summary</h2>
    <p>
        Hello, I’m Agalya Ayyadurai, a versatile professional with over 6+ years of experience navigating the exciting worlds of
        Software Quality Assurance and Data Science. I bring a unique perspective that combines a meticulous approach to testing
        with the analytical depth of data-driven decision-making. This dual expertise allows me to deliver robust, innovative
        solutions that not only work but inspire confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
        In my QA role, I specialize in crafting automation frameworks, optimizing testing workflows, and ensuring seamless user
        experiences. As a Data Scientist, I transform raw data into actionable insights, leveraging machine learning models and
        visualization tools to empower business decisions. Together, these roles allow me to merge precision with creativity,
        uncovering opportunities for innovation at every step.
    </p>
    <p>
        My philosophy is simple: technology should serve people. Whether it’s building resilient systems or deciphering complex
        datasets, I thrive on solving meaningful challenges that make a tangible impact. At the heart of my work is a dedication
        to collaboration, continuous learning, and creating solutions that resonate.

    <!-- Key Ac hievements -->
    <h2>Key Achievements</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Implemented an end-to-end API test collection in Postman within 5 days, addressing a critical bottleneck in identifying
            backend issues during frontend development. The collection included over 100 APIs, focusing on testing the logic of a
            web app used by doctors and a mobile app used by patients, achieving 99.9% test coverage for API scenarios.
        </li>
        <li>
            Led the transition from a waterfall model to an agile development approach, introducing and optimizing tools like JIRA,
            Confluence, and BitBucket. Established sprint planning, backlog prioritization, and JIRA workflows, reducing costs by
            managing environments dynamically and streamlining processes. This system has been successfully operational for over
            three years.
        </li>
        <li>
            Enhanced an existing LightGBM model for detecting indoor and outdoor environments based on mobile sensor data.
            Addressed overfitting issues using SMOTE for oversampling and engineered temporal features through rolling statistics,
            improving the model's F1 score from 61 to 71.
        </li>
        <li>
            Successfully balanced a dual role as a Software QA Engineer and Data Scientist over the past year, effectively
            managing workloads and prioritizing tasks to consistently meet deadlines. Identified critical issues before production,
            reducing production-level bugs by approximately 99%.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Core Values and Personality -->
    <h2>Core Values and Personality</h2>
    <p>
        As an INFJ, I bring empathy, strategy, and creativity to everything I do. I’m someone who thrives on
        collaboration, finding innovative solutions, and creating systems that are as intuitive as they are powerful.
        I believe great technology stems from great teamwork, and I love fostering environments where ideas flourish.
    </p>
    <p>
        I’m meticulous about the details but never lose sight of the bigger picture. My QA experience teaches me to
        anticipate risks and eliminate flaws, while my Data Science work inspires me to find patterns and craft solutions
        with precision and ingenuity.
    </p>

    <!-- Passion Statement -->
    <h2>Passion Statement</h2>
    <p>
        I believe technology is as much about people as it is about systems. As a QA Engineer, I ensure that every
        application I test is intuitive, reliable, and user-friendly. As a Data Scientist, I unravel stories hidden in
        data, helping businesses make informed decisions. The combination of these two fields allows me to craft solutions
        that are not only functional but impactful.
    </p>
    <p>
        I thrive on solving puzzles, whether it's debugging a complex code issue or finding the perfect feature set for
        a predictive model. To me, every challenge is an opportunity to learn, grow, and make a difference.
    </p>

    <!-- Personal Interests -->
    <h2>Personal Interests</h2>
    <p>
        Dancing has been a lifelong passion of mine since the age of 12. Over the years, I’ve honed my skills in various styles,
        including hip-hop, street jazz, contemporary, and Indian folk dance. During my university days, I founded and led a dance crew
        of more than 10 talented girls, choreographing routines for multiple events and competitions. One of our proudest moments
        was securing the runner-up position at a prestigious cultural event hosted by our university. Dancing continues to be my creative
        outlet, allowing me to express myself and connect with others through movement.
    </p>
    <p>
        I have a deep love for arts and crafts, particularly sewing, crocheting, and embroidery. In fact, I took a dedicated
        break from my career from 2015 to 2018 to master dressmaking. During this time, I created unique outfits for family
        and friends, and even ventured into the commercial space. There’s something incredibly fulfilling about turning
        threads and fabrics into intricate patterns and wearable art.
    </p>
    <p>
        As someone who loves finding patterns—whether in data or in life—I’ve pursued a side hustle in forex trading.
        My favorite currency pair is EUR/USD, and I’ve honed my skills to achieve a 70% profit this year alone. It’s a
        thrilling combination of strategy, analysis, and adaptability.
    </p>
    <p>
        My one-year-old niece is the light of my life. Her curiosity, critical thinking, and love for books (and food!)
        inspire me daily. She transformed my life from a period of darkness into one filled with happiness, laughter, and
        purpose. Watching the world through her eyes has been a gift beyond measure.
    </p>
    <p>
        I’m passionate about exploring topics that inspire personal growth, resilience, and a deeper understanding of life’s challenges.
        This reflective mindset shapes how I approach both personal and professional experiences.
    </p>

    <p>
        When it comes to sports, I enjoy exploring different games, although table tennis is my current favorite. I’ve
        recently taken to playing with my colleagues during lunch breaks, and it’s a great way to stay active and have fun.
        Speaking of fitness, I’ve started hitting the gym at least four days a week. My focus is on becoming healthier,
        stronger, and more mobile—especially after long hours of working at a desk. Functional fitness has been a game-changer
        for me.
    </p>
    <p>
        Like many, I enjoy unwinding with Netflix, though I confess I’m a bit of a loyalist when it comes to my favorites.
        I’ve watched <em>Friends</em> and <em>Gilmore Girls</em> countless times—seven full cycles of <em>Friends</em> so far—and
        I’m confident I could ace any <em>Friends</em> trivia quiz!
