    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <!-- Introduction & Background -->
    <p>
        I’m <strong>Agalya Ayyadurai</strong>—a versatile professional with
        <strong>6+ years</strong> as a <strong>Software Test Engineer</strong>,
        <strong>1 year</strong> as a <strong>Data Analyst</strong> and <strong>Data Scientist</strong>,
        <strong>2 years</strong> as a <strong>Project Manager</strong>, along with a bit of experience in
        design and development.
    </p>
    <p>
        Over the course of my career, I’ve embraced diverse roles and responsibilities
        that have shaped me into a well-rounded individual capable of thriving in various domains.
        While my expertise spans many areas, my primary focus and passion remain rooted in
        <strong>Software Test Engineering</strong> and <strong>Data Science</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2>My Journey</h2>
    <p>
        As a child, two things fascinated me more than anything else—<strong>math</strong> and <strong>computer science</strong>. Math came naturally to me; I loved every class and often scored perfectly without much effort. On the other hand, computer science wasn’t easily accessible at school, but my teachers went the extra mile to introduce us to tools like Word, Excel, Paint, and WordArt—basic but magical for a young learner like me.
    </p>
    <p>
        Growing up, I faced two challenges. Advanced math became harder to grasp—it was the first time I didn’t immediately understand it. While part of me blamed the teaching style, I knew deep down I hadn’t put in enough effort. This humbling experience taught me <strong>resilience, hard work</strong>, and the importance of being kind to myself while learning. Meanwhile, my fascination with computer science lingered, but I didn’t dive into it seriously until later in life.
    </p>
    <p>
        That turning point came when I started my career at <strong>Cognizant Technology Solutions</strong> as a Programmer Analyst, primarily responsible for software testing. I found innovative ways to simplify testing, creating Excel macros and using advanced functions like VLOOKUP. Yet, the real transformation began when I pursued my MSc in <strong>Data Science</strong> at the <strong>University of Surrey</strong> at 28. It was here that I fully immersed myself in programming, tools, and technologies, igniting a passion that continues to grow.
    </p>
    <p>
        Today, I find joy in blending design, development, testing, and data science. My passion lies in mastering my craft, learning new tools and technologies, and delivering work that’s not just efficient but meaningful. I value strong team connections, understanding people, and fostering positive relationships—even with those who may initially seem challenging. I thrive on collaboration and believe that a supportive team can accomplish amazing things.
    </p>
    <p>
        I’m proud of my ability to see the bigger picture and find positives in any situation, even under pressure. For me, success isn’t about titles or promotions—it’s about the impact of my work. I strive to solve problems in the simplest way possible, creating solutions that are not only elegant but valuable to the business and the people it serves.
    </p>
    <p>
        At the heart of my philosophy is this: <strong>Work should be fulfilling and fun</strong>. Build connections, help others, and keep learning. Whether it’s a complex project or a small task, my goal is always the same—to deliver quality work that makes a difference.
